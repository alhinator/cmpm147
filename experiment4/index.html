				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment consists of three unique infinite worlds, inspired by different things. These are my
					following inspiration images:
				</p>
				<p>World 1:</p>
				<img src="https://files.utilitylog.com/img/Snake-game-on-Google.png" width="300">
				<p>The first world is a spin on snake game, making it infinite while keeping the theme colors of the
					Google rendition of the game.</p>
				<p>World 2:</p>
				<img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/view-endless-city-landscape-drone-d-rendering-concept-285045203.jpg"
					width="400">

					width="400">
				<p>The world is inspired by the concept of an infinite city, but I wanted to also implement color
					gradients similar to the game Townscaper.</p>
				<p>World 3:</p>
				<img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/30763/227/1000/1000/638061153443493893.png"
					width="400">
				<p>The last world is an "airborne" spin on the infinite snake game I created for World 1. Inspired by a
					friend, as well as the "Couatl" winged snake.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				Each world has different rules for its generation, but they are all built around the same framework
				provided by {amsmith,ikarth}@ucsc.edu. World 1 uses simple odd/even tiling to create the green
				checkerboard pattern seen in Google Snake, and then checks the noise value of each drawn tile to see if
				a wall should be drawn, with a height based on the noise level. World 3 works in a similar way, but only
				draws a single light blue square over
				the background; the clouds are determined the same way and use a simple oscillator as a modulo of
				millis().
				<p></p>
				World 2 uses a slightly more in-depth computation. To start, the world's seed determines a base RGB
				color by hashing the seed into three numbers between 0 and 255. Next, it calculates a "road offset" for
				the X and Y dimensions, detemining how far apart the roads will be.
				<p></p>
				It uses a green-tint of the base color to draw the "grass", affected slightly by the tile's position,
				then draws roads on their x & y offset values, using a 4-way tile checker to autotile.
				<p></p>
				Lastly, it draws buildings if the noise of a tile is greater than a given value, giving the building
				height based on that noise. The color of the building is determined by the base color offset by an
				amount calculated by the tile's position.
				<p></p>
				A simple click checker cycles tiles not already specified as roads to be either grass, road, or
				building.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				While I did enjoy this project, I feel I would have struggled less if my effort was put into polishing one world instead of building and iterating three different ones.
