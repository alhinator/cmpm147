				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment was mostly centered around getting familiar with Glitch, project workflow, and submission requirements. As an introduction to generative design, it uses simple randomness and a text-based template to generate a large variety of mixed drinks.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Technically, this project is fairly simple. It uses a premade template with lists of words that fit into categories, mad-libs style, and fills words into the correct spots into the template with simple randomness and string matching.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The coding process was simple; the only difficulty was figuring out what the thing to be generated was - after that, filling in the template words was quick and painless. I added some quick customization so the button and textbox fit the theme of the rest of the portfolio page as well. </p>
