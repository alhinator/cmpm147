				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment consists of two separate "worlds" - one Overworld and one Dungeon. Each is generated
					with different rules, and have different features.
					(Both worlds use tiles from <a
						href="https://thkaspar.itch.io/micro-tileset-overworld-dungeon">[Micro Tileset - Overworld &
						Dungeon]</a> by
					<a href="https://thkaspar.itch.io/">[thkaspar]</a>)
				</p>
				<p>The first world is a snowy forest scene. It contains a hill that begins on the left side of the
					canvas and works its way down, stepping left or right after short intervals. The grass on the hill
					is lighter and it is surrounded by cliffs. After the hill is generated, clumps of forests are
					created based on noise(), and given shading based on whether they are 'raised' on the hill, or
					lowered on the rest of the valley. Houses are placed on open "lowered" tiles with simple randomness.
					Both light and dark grass (and their snowy variants) contain variation as simple randomness.
				</p>
				<p>The overworld text-codes are:
				<ul>
					<li>"." = Lowered Grass/Snow</li>
					<li>"T" = Lowered Tree</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>"," = Raised Grass/Snow</li>
					<li>"W" = Raised Tree</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>The "signs of life" in the overworld are tiles drawn with or without snow based on noise as a
					function
					of time. Additionally, the shadows of clouds loop across the screen, resetting & changing
					position/size
					when they leave the edge of the canvas.</p>


				<p>My second world creates a single dungeon room by combining adjacent rectangles. Chests have a rare
					chance to generate on open tiles - and a rarer chance to be a golden chest. Variation in the "Wall"
					tiles is a function of noise() and position, and variation in the floor tiles is simple random,
					which is affected by the shape and number of open tiles in the room. This way, it feels more like
					the user is "carving" a dungeon room out of the static, surrounding stone, while the interior of the
					room is more active.</p>

				<p>The dungeon text-codes are:
				<ul>
					<li>"."= Wall</li>
					<li>"," = Open Area</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				In addition to editing the text-box to the right of the "world", the user can click on tiles in the
				Dungeon to swap them between "wall" and "open", indicated by the selected tile
				highlighted in a certain color.
				</p>
				<p>Both worlds use four-directional bitmasking to determine which tilemap sprite should be used; in the
					Overworld, it decorates the edges of cliffs and treelines, and in the Dungeon, it surrounds the open
					areas with walls.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In both worlds, the generation and rendering of each world are done separately. The "canvases" take
					place in two different p5.js instances, however, p5.js source shares a single randomSeed and
					noiseSeed, so re-seeding one world partially re-seeds the other - but only for the noise-based
					rendering, not the seed-based generation.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In the Overworld, the map generation & rendering takes place in 3 steps for each phase.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>First, the map is filled with "lowered" grass as a starting point.</li>
					<li>The hill on the left is drawn from the top down, filling any tiles to the left of it with
						"raised" grass. As it travels down, it paints a certain amount of tiles, then moves left or
						right randomly, then paints a random amount more tiles, and repeats until it has reached the
						bottom of the grid.</li>
					<li>Then, it uses noise to scatter trees across the map in clumps, designating them as "raised" or
						"lowered" depending on what the grass was before the tree was placed.</li>
					<p></p>
					<li>After the map is done generating, the grass is drawn each frame. Bitmasking is used to determine
						the tile's sprite when any lowered grass borders a raised grass, and to determine the shape of
						trees. During this process, noise as a function of position and time is used to determine
						whether or not the tile should be drawn as snowy.</li>
					<li>Houses are then placed randomly; each tile is checked for the possibility of a house.</li>
					<li>Lastly, the shadows of clouds are drawn over the map, traveling southeast as a function of time
						and noise - they change size, shape, and reset position when leaving the canvas, and the number
						of clouds changes based on the random seed.</li>
				</ol>
				<p></p>
				<p>In the Dungeon, the generation and rendering is simpler, only taking place in 4 steps. My focus for
					this world was on the interactivity through mouse clicks.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>First, the map is filled with red "wall" tiles, which are given variation based on a function of
						noise and position.</li>
					<li>Second, a series of bordering rectangles are placed onto the map, "carving" out a single,
						contiguous room. <dl>â†’ The pseudocode for the room generation is as follows:</dl>
						<dd>- Create a rectangle between 2 tiles and 1/4 the total tiles wide (and tall). It's placed at
							least one tile away from the edge.</dd>
						<dd>- Pick a border edge, and create a rectangle along that edge that extends towards the center
							of the map, regardless of the original border edge.</dd>
						<dd>- Repeat this process between 3 and 12 times, based on the seed.</dd>
					</li>
					<li>Every frame, the "open" tiles are decorated with variating sprites based on simple randomness -
						they change whenever the room is altered, but not every frame.</li>
					<li>Additionally, open tiles that border one or more wall tiles are decorated with walls using the
						same style of bitmasking as the overworld's cliffs and trees.</li>
					<p></p>
				</ol>
				<p>In the Dungeon, the user may click on any tile to swap it between a "wall" tile and an "open"
					tile. This is done by taking the mouse's position as a percentage of the canvas width/height, and
					converting that to a tile position. Then, a simple listener edits the map & text-box codes on click.
					A selection rectangle is drawn using the same position-to-tile conversion with a different color
					based on the tile currently being hovered.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In the beginning of the coding process, I was very confused at how the bitmasking was supposed to
					work. However, after trying to do it differently, it dawned on me how it actually worked, and I had
					minimal issues with bitmasking via the intended style from there on out. The only other issue I had
					was that after
					finishing both worlds on Glitch, I needed to convert them to p5.js's "instanced mode" in order to
					place
					multiple canvases on one webpage. Luckily, this wasn't too difficult, and it mostly consisted of
					copy
					pasting member prefixes in front of all my variables and functions ad nauseum.</p>
