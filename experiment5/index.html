					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This project focuses on replicating an image through single, simple shapes using randomness and
						match checking. It draws a preset number of shapes (defined by the shape dropdown) of varying
						sizes and positions across the canvas, filling them with color based on their position relative
						to the original image's color at that pixel. Every frame, it "mutates" each of those shapes by
						an amount determined by the slider and a gaussian noise function, changing their position, size,
						and rotation (triangle only). This rapid mutation is displayed as the top image/canvas. Whenever
						the program finds a "best fit" match, ie the pixels of the image match the pixels of the canvas,
						it uses that series of shapes as its new base, mutating from there instead of the original
						design. Every time a new best fit match is found, it's displayed in the middle display until a
						newer fit is found; it's then moved to the list at the bottom.</p>
					<p>The user may change the shape with which the replica image is being drawn, as well as enter an
						accessible URL to replicate their own image.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>One technical standout of this project was the ability to grab the pixel color from the original
						image. This involved some experimenting due to the canvas being shrunk down to accomodate higher
						rendering speeds, but the original image's pixel array still being full-sized. I had to
						trial-and-error different ways for the program to translate between the two in order to not
						encounter both index errors as well as visual bugs.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After the new instruction slides dropped, I'd already completed something similar, but not quite
						right. However i'd implemented color in that project, so it was easy to port over into this one
						and create the same pixel-grabbing effect. Additionally, I really enjoyed messing with my draw
						settings to improve visual clarity, especially manipulating transparency based on shape size -
						and shape size based on draw order, rather than randomness.</p>
