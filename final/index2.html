            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            <p>Gem-etic Dungeon is a procedural dungeon generator that uses 8-length genes to create interesting
                dungeon layouts.</p>

            <p>As the player collects gems in the dungeon, they will build a gene value which gets fed through a
                machine learning pipeline to map out a genetic sequence; this sequence is then mixed with the current
                room seed using a non-survival based genetic parenting algorithm, creating a chain of evolving dungeon
                rooms influenced by the player's actions.</p>

            <p>Gem-etic Dungeon is a procgen dungeon with 65536 possible length-8 genes consisting of Water, Earth,
                Fire, and Air; these genes are used in combination with 65536 possible seeds (after seeding SFC-32
                random and noisejs 32-bit perlin libraries), allowing for 4294967296 possible unique dungeons, not
                including non-impactful decoration variants. The gene of a dungeon affects the following individual
                aspects of a room:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Room Shape
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gem Spawning Style
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obstacle Type
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wall Decoration
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hallway Type
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enemy Type (unused, was stretch goal)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Floor Decoration
                </li>
                <li>
                    Theme (coloration & sub-room placement algo)
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <p>The core gameplay loop of our program is as follows: First, convert an initial user-provided seed into a
                formatted seed & initial gene. Then, generate a deterministic dungeon based on seed and gene: this is
                then rendered into Phaser.js. The player may walk around the dungeon for as long as they want, exploring
                and picking up gems. Once they step on a blue “exit” tile, a trained, sequential neural network predicts
                a gene string for a given gem sequence based on the gems they’ve collected. A parental algorithm
                (non-survival genetic algorithm) mixes the two ‘parent’ genes (current room, gem gene) and creates a
                ‘child’ gene as the offspring. That child gene is then generated into a dungeon and rendered into
                Phaser, and the loop continues.</p>

            <h2>Technical</h2>
            <p>The main project was written in TypeScript and bundled with Webpack. About a third of the project is
                documented to JSDoc standards, and we used Git version control.</p>
            <p>Alongside the standard Math.random provided by JS, we use instanced versions of the SFC-32 deterministic
                randomness function to isolate per-room randomness to ensure deterministic outcomes. XXH-64 hashing is
                used for hashing user input strings. The noisejs library is included as well, to provide simple fast 2d
                perlin noise. Both the SFC-32 and noisejs libraries are limited to 65536 possible seeds as opposed to
                XXH-64’s 64-bit output, so seeding is unfortunately lossy.</p>
            <p>The game itself is based on the Phaser.js web platform, which has built in Tiled tilemap implementation;
                we used manual 4-bit autotiling as seen in previous experiments.</p>
            <p>Gene mapping is done with a Sequential Neural Network written in Python with the Keras library; this is
                containerized with Docker and hosted on the cloud with Heroku. API calls are made to this external
                server whenever a gem sequence needs to be mapped into a gene.</p>
            <p>The parental algorithm utilizes a forced mutation system as well as a rock-paper-scissors style of
                inheritance. The algorithm accepts an initial gene alongside a “new” gene; each letter of the initial
                gene has a small chance to mutate, and is then compared against each letter of the new gene. The
                “winner” of the rochambeau style determination is then placed into the final gene, one letter at a time,
                and the completed new gene is returned to the rest of the program.</p>
            <p>Generating the dungeon itself is a lengthy process, but boils down to the following set of algorithms:
                Create the empty tilemap as an ASCII array, place the center of each subroom based on the room’s theme
                and hallway type, connect the rooms with hallways based on the room’s hallway type, fill each subroom
                with gems based on the room’s gem placement type, fill the room with traps based on the room’s trap
                placement type, and finally, place the entrance and exits. The 2d ASCII array is then converted to a 1d
                integer array (Phaser’s preferred tilemap format) and made accessible to the Phaser game loop.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>As the lead for generating the dungeon map based on just a gene and seed, I had a lot of creative room to
                work with, and I think I did pretty well given the time and resources I had. My work in this project
                definitely prioritized breadth over depth, so at some points I felt like some of the variations I was
                creating in the generator weren’t as impactful as they could have been – but seeing the final project
                and the sheer amount of unique spaces the player sees is very awesome. I wish we’d had more time to add
                more gameplay features like combat, player abilities, etc; but that wasn’t the focus of the project. I
                think something I would have liked to dive deeper into given more time was cyclical level design; but
                that concept wasn't fully introduced and I wasn’t familiar with it until the project was already in full
                swing, so pivoting to focus on that would have severely dented overall quality. Modular generation also
                could've been a nice addition to this project, but I started the project with non-modular genning, so it
                would’ve been an alternate option rather than an addition. Watching the dungeon levels progress from an
                ASCII array in the console, to a crappy placeholder tilemap, to a fully fleshed out game system was so
                satisfying, and this project is something I’m going to be happy to have in my portfolio.</p>
            <p>Work-wise, I built the entirety of the Generator.ts and Start.ts files, which are responsible for
                dungeon generation, and the homescreen/start screen of the Phaser game, respectively. Additionally, I
                worked on Dungeon.ts, heading autotiling and tilemap decoration, and providing polish to other parts of
                Dungeon.ts and Intermission.ts when necessary. Big shoutouts to CJ for his support with bundling
                typescript and Jackson for his awesome art.</p>
